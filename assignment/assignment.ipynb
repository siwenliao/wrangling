        "2. Categorical variable: For the Minnesota police use of for data, `./data/mn_police_use_of_force.csv`, clean the `subject_injury` variable, handling the NA's; this gives a value `Yes` when a person was injured by police, and `No` when no injury occurred. What proportion of the values are missing? Is this a concern? Cross-tabulate your cleaned `subject_injury` variable with the `force_type` variable. Are there any patterns regarding when the data are missing?\n",
        "3. Dummy variable: For the pretrial data covered in the lecture, clean the `WhetherDefendantWasReleasedPretrial` variable as well as you can, and, in particular, replace missing values with `np.nan`.\n",

We can also see that from the sentence type variable that there are different sentence types, and some charges may not have resulted in a sentence. This indicates that the missing values have meaning and are not random. Hence, we can leave the missing values as is, so I did not clean any further."

For example '17 ' would be replaced by 15. There were also age categories expressed qualitively. Middle-aged was replaced with 45, teen was replaced with 15, and adult was replaced with 40. If there were multiple ages listed as one value, the average of all the ages were taken and sorted to the closest age category. Values that contained a question mark but also a number were sorted to the age category closest to the non-questioned ages. Data that did not resemble any age were replaced with np.nan. From the histogram of cleaned data, we can see that most shark attacks happen to people around 15."

        "1. This paper is about tidy datasets, defined by its structural framework of obervations as rows, variables as columns, and type of unit as tables. The paper seems to introduce the concept and talk about its benefits and applications to improve data cleaning and address the lack of research.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. The \"tidy data standard\" intends to accomplish a consistent framework that can be used when cleaning any dataset and provide the foundation for initial exploration and analysis.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. \"Like families, tidy datasets are all alike but every messy dataset is messy in its own way\" draws an analogy between datasets and families. Generally, when considering functional and \"non-messy\" families, there is a framework that is visualized: a nice house, 1-3 kids, etc. However, when thinking of messy families, there isn't a standard framework. Each familiy may have different extended family drama, external pressures, internal issues, etc. Thus, the analogy says that similar to families, the range in diversity of tidy datasets is a lot more narrow than messy ones. \"For a given dataset, it’s usually easy to figure out what are observations and what are variables, but it is surprisingly difficult to precisely define variables and observations in general\" means that identifying the variables of interest is easy but figuring out specific relationships and how to capture the nuances of data through the variables are difficult.\n",
        "\n",
        "4.  Values are what is being collected in a dataset. Values are usually numbers if quantitative or strings if qualitative. A variable contains all values that measure the same underlying attribute across units. An observation contains all values measured on the same unit across attributes.\n",
        "\n",
        "5. Tidy data is a standard way of mapping the meaning of a dataset to its structure. In tidy data, each variable forms a column, each observation forms a row, and each type of observational unit forms a table.\n",
        "\n",
        "6. The five most common problems with messy datasets:\n",
        "\n",
        "*   Column headers are values, not variable names.\n",
        "*   Multiple variables are stored in one column.\n",
        "*   Variables are stored in both rows and columns.\n",
        "*   Multiple types of observational units are stored in the same table.\n",
        "*   A single observational unit is stored in multiple tables.\n",
        "\n",
        "The data in Table 4 is messy because both the rows and columns are variables, and the the column headers are values instead of variable names. \"Melting\" a dataset is turning columns into rows. It is parametrised by a list of columns that are already variables. The other columns are converted into two variables.\n",
        "\n",
        "7) Table 11 has variables stored in both rows and columns. There are  variables in individual columns such as \"year\", but then the table also has each day of the month as a separate column. Additionally, in each row, the minimum and maximum temperature is specified, so this hints that there are potentially two entries for each date (the maximum temperature and the minimum temperature). Table 12 addresses these issues. Table 12(a) is \"molten\" because it addresses the issues in the columns by condensing down the date into one column. Table 12(b) is tidy because it addresses the issue in the rows by making the minimum and maximum temperature columns instead of rows. Following the rules of a tidy dataset, there is one variable in each column, and each row represents a single data (or single observation).\n",
        "\n",
        "8) The \"chicken-and-egg\" problem with focusing on tidy data is that tidy data depends on the tools, and the tools are built for using tidy data. This loop makes it difficult to identify a breakthrough point because both the data structure and tools need to be changed together and accordingly to create significant improvements Wickham hopes that in the future, research will build on the tidy data framework to develop even better data storage strategies and tools to improve data cleaning."
